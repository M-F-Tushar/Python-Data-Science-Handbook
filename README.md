pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn jupyter
```
Running the Notebooks
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-F-Tushar/Python-Data-Science-Handbook.git
```
Navigate to the notebooks directory:
```bash
cd Python-Data-Science-Handbook/notebooks
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
```bash
